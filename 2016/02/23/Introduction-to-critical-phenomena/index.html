    	<p>Update: I don’t know what I have written, and I will rewrite it after learning enough condensed matter field theory (it will not be long)</p>
<p>Recently I skim over a book called `miracle of boundary: phase transition and critical phenomena’. Though published 30 years ago, it provides a brief picture of many important concepts in modern condensed matter physics.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Phase-transition"><a href="#Phase-transition" class="headerlink" title="Phase transition."></a>Phase transition.</h2><p>Phase transition is the abrupt change of physical properties; for instance, when water concretes, its density increases discontinuously. It is due to the balance of particle interaction and thermal fluctuation. Phase transition happens when one overwhelms another.</p>
<h2 id="Mean-field-theory"><a href="#Mean-field-theory" class="headerlink" title="Mean-field theory."></a>Mean-field theory.</h2><p>From the view point of symmetry, there is a simple but powerful theory of phase transition. As we know, discontinuity could only comes from discontinuity, but physical quantity, as long as it is a quantity, varies continuously. There is a exception: symmetry, which can only be existent or nonexistent.</p>
<p>Landau’s theory uses order parameter and spontaneous symmetry breaking to describe the process of phase transition and is able to calculate critical exponent. In brief, it says as some quantity varies continuously, whether `spontaneous symmetry breaking’ exists of not varies abruptly.</p>
<p>By the way, there is also phase transition in complex networks, where `symmetry’ seems to disappear; however, I do not know what theory provides a unified frame like Landau’s theory.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-do-statistical-physics"><a href="#How-to-do-statistical-physics" class="headerlink" title="How to do statistical physics."></a>How to do statistical physics.</h2><p>Partition function is just like characteristic function. When dealing a problem of probability, we can first calculate the characteristic function of some random variable, and then all the statistical moments can be derived from its derivatives.</p>
<p>Similarly, partition function contains all the information of a system in statistical physics. So the standard steps solving a statistical physics problem is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Find the energy spectrum.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calculate the partition function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do derivation to find all the thermodynamic quantities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The last two steps is quite standard, so it is often the first step that the most difficult.</p>
<h2 id="Scaling-law-and-universality-and-renormalization-group"><a href="#Scaling-law-and-universality-and-renormalization-group" class="headerlink" title="Scaling law and universality and renormalization group."></a>Scaling law and universality and renormalization group.</h2><p>To be honest, I do not understand them very much.</p>
<p>As far as I know, a physical system has odd behavior at its critical point because of the divergence of correlation length. Usually, a physical system only has local correlation; however, at critical point, long-scale correlation emerges, which is independent of the microscopic details. This is the origin of universality, i.e., completely different physical system can share common quantitative relations, such as the critical exponent.</p>
<p>Renormalization group provides a powerful tool to understand this situation and it is also a powerful method of calculation. At the critical point, the system is self-similar, which means coarse-graining does not change the system up to a re-scaling of units. The operation of coarse-graining forms a semi-group, called renormalization group, and critical point is just the fixed point of renormalization.</p>
<h2 id="Epilogue"><a href="#Epilogue" class="headerlink" title="Epilogue"></a>Epilogue</h2><p>I only know some words right now, however, I believe I will soon learn much more about them in statistical physics and condensed matter field theory.</p>
